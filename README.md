# SchoolHelper
A chrome extension to help with things school related

## Stuff it does
- Solves two duolingo question types
  - Multiple choice
  - Normal text box/word bank select
    - This auto swaps from word bank mode to text box mode because it is easier to solve.
    - This one is a little messed up, but functions. It autofills the text in the box, and then makes sure the box is not edited for 1 second (idk why I had to do this but I had to so). Also, you need to type **something** in the text box for duolingo to make the sumbit button clickable
- Redirects all discord urls to `ptb.discord.com` to bypass hosts file blocking
